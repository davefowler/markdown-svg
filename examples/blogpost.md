# A Quick Guide to Markdown

*Now you can render Markdown directly to SVG! For those who don't know or need a refresher, here's an overview with examples.*

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you write formatted text using plain text syntax. It's used everywhere: GitHub, Reddit, Notion, and now... **SVG images**!

## Text Formatting

Make text **bold** with double asterisks, *italic* with single asterisks, or ***both*** with triple. You can also use `inline code` with backticks.

Need to ~~strike through~~ something? Use double tildes.

## Headings

Headings use hash symbols. One `#` for h1, two `##` for h2, and so on down to `######` for h6. Simple!

## Lists

**Unordered lists** use dashes, asterisks, or plus signs:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

**Ordered lists** use numbers:

1. Do this first
2. Then do this
3. Finally, do this

## Links and Images

Links look like this: [Visit GitHub](https://github.com)

Images are similar but with an exclamation mark:

## Code Blocks

For multi-line code, use triple backticks:

```python
def hello(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(hello("World"))
```

## Blockquotes
